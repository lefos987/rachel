		<p>Your website should work the way your users expect it to.
		It should be organised in a way that makes it easier for them to find the information they need without pulling out their hair.
		It should speak their language.
		It should tell your users where they are and how to get where they’re going.</p>
		<h5>Let me help</h5>
		<p>As a user experience consultant, I will work closely with you to get an in-depth understanding of your business, your customers and what you’re trying to achieve digitally. I have 17 years experience working on digital projects for large companies. I specialise in crafting exceptional user experiences that are clear, simple, and engaging.</p>
		<p>Technology and digital media have become more complex and more interactive, leading to a more demanding landscape for both clients and their customers. My role is to help you by not only creating the best possible user experience but also by understanding capabilities, risks, constraints and opportunities around all aspects of your project.</p>
		<p>If you’d like to discuss working with me or you’d like more information please get in touch.
